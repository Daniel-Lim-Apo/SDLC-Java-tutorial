# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used by software engineers and developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software systems. It defines the stages and methodologies used in the development of software, aiming to improve the quality of the product while ensuring that it meets customer requirements within a given timeline and budget.

## Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**:
   - During this phase, stakeholders and project managers gather requirements from the client or users. 
   - The goal is to understand what the system needs to do. This is usually documented in the form of a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**.
   - Tools: Interviews, questionnaires, requirement gathering workshops.

2. **System Design**:
   - In this phase, the architecture of the system is designed. High-level design (HLD) focuses on modules and their relationships, while low-level design (LLD) details the actual logic for each module.
   - The design may include database design, software architecture, UI/UX design, etc.
   - Output: **System Architecture Document**.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**:
   - This is the phase where developers start coding based on the design documents. The code is written in a programming language suitable for the project.
   - The output is the actual software code or application.
   - Developers often follow coding standards and practices like version control (Git).

4. **Testing**:
   - Once the code is developed, it's tested to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the SRS document.
   - There are various types of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
   - The goal is to identify and fix bugs to improve software quality.

5. **Deployment**:
   - After testing is successful, the software is deployed to the production environment for use by the end-users.
   - In some cases, this phase may involve deploying the system in stages (like alpha or beta testing) before a full release.
   - The deployment process is automated in many modern systems (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - CI/CD).

6. **Maintenance**:
   - This phase begins once the software is in use. It involves bug fixing, updates, and enhancements to ensure the software continues to meet user needs.
   - Maintenance can be adaptive, perfective, or corrective.

## SDLC Models

Several models or methodologies define how the stages of SDLC are structured:

1. **Waterfall Model**:
   - A linear, sequential model where each phase depends on the completion of the previous phase.
   - It's simple but inflexible in handling changes in requirements later in the cycle.

2. **Agile Model**:
   - This iterative model emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration. The project is broken down into smaller chunks, known as sprints, each delivering a portion of functionality.
   - Agile encourages frequent releases and changes based on user feedback.

3. **V-Model (Verification and Validation)**:
   - This model is a variation of the Waterfall model. Each development phase is associated with a corresponding testing phase.
   - It emphasizes parallel testing and development, improving the overall quality.

4. **Spiral Model**:
   - Combines iterative and Waterfall models, where the project passes through multiple iterations (spirals), each involving risk analysis and refinement of the product.

5. **DevOps Model**:
   - A recent evolution that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It emphasizes automation, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD).
   - The goal is faster and more reliable releases with close collaboration between development and operations teams.
